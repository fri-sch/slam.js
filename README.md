# slam.js - Kleinkunst Competition Interactive Slides

This is a plugin for the reveal.js HTML presentation framework, that allows to
create interactive slides for live competitions like poetry slams and the like.

The contestants present their contributions on stage and get rated by a jury or
by the audience. As the ratings are presented, they are entered into the control
interface and shown to the audience.

## Attributions

Slam.js is based on the reveal.js framework and in particular on the
server-notes plugin.

Some of the libraries in use are:

* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* jsGrid
* lowDB
* socket.io

## Usage

Note: I'm not a web developer and therefore parts of the code are likely to look
ugly or perform bad. If you find issues please report them.

## Events

I have written slam.js for "1. Esslinger Preacher Slam" in 2018. Since then it
received an almost complete rewrite to be ready for "2. Esslinger Preacher Slam"
on 26 October 2019.

If you happen to use slam.js for an event, please let me know or send a PR to
extend the list below.
